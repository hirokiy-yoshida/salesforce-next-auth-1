# Salesforce Authentication in Next.js using NextAuth

## Introduction

This project was created to demonstrate how to use NextAuth to Authenticate Salesforce as the provider of the authentication. There is no critical data that are being stored.

There is no database involved, it only uses the access_token and refresh_token provided by the salesforce after the authentication, and by that, we can use the Refresh Rotation Strategy. 

This project also uses the JsForce library to retrieve some data from Salesforce after signing in.
