# Salesforce Authentication in Next.js using NextAuth

## Introduction

This project was created to demonstrate how to use [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) to Authenticate [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) as the provider of the authentication. There is no critical data that are being stored.

There is no database involved, it only uses the `access_token` and `refresh_token` provided by the Salesforce after the authentication, and by that, we can use the [Refresh Rotation Strategy](https://next-auth.js.org/tutorials/refresh-token-rotation).

This project also uses the [jsforce](https://jsforce.github.io) library to retrieve some data from Salesforce after the authentication is completed.
